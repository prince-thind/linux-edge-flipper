# linux-edge-flipper

Simple utility to allow shifting workspaces when the cursor reaches one of the edges. This feature is built in KDE but not present in cinnamon. But say no more! you can add the bundled script ('main' file found in the releases section of github) in your "startup applications" and voila you've got a clone of the KDE feature (albeit a lot less optimized :p)
